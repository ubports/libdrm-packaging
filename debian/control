Package: libdrm-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: linux-libc-dev (>= 2.6.28) [linux-any], libdrm2 (= ${binary:Version}), libdrm-intel1 (= ${binary:Version}) [amd64 i386 kfreebsd-amd64 kfreebsd-i386]
Description: Userspace interface to kernel DRM services -- development files
 This library implements the userspace interface to the kernel DRM
 services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the
 kernelspace portion of the "Direct Rendering Infrastructure" (DRI).
 The DRI is currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated
 OpenGL drivers.
 .
 This package provides the development environment for libdrm.

Description: Userspace interface to intel-specific kernel DRM services -- runtime
 This library implements the userspace interface to the intel-specific kernel
 DRM services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the
 kernelspace portion of the "Direct Rendering Infrastructure" (DRI). The DRI is
 currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL drivers.
 .
 This package is built from a snapshot of DRM development code, to provide the
 features necessary for testing new X.org drivers.  Do NOT expect this package
 to be stable!
